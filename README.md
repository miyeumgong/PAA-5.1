I've selected coffee coupons for independent investigation.
The implications of the analysis are:

#1 Age: The younger passengers (e.g., below 21) show significantly higher acceptance rates than the older group.
#2 Gender: No significant difference between genders
#3 Marital Status: Widowed group shows significantly lower acceptance rate than the other groups.
#4 Passenger Type: Friend(s) and Partner groups show higher accepance rate.
#5 Time of Day: The coupons are more accepted at 10am and 2pm.
#6 Destination: No urgent plan group shows significantly higher acceptance rate.
#7 Weather: Snowy group shows much lower acceptance rate.
#8 Expiration Time: One-day group shows higher acceptance rate.
